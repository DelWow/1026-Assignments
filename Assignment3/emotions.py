This is the emotion file for my assignment. It contains all the functions needed to generate a report about the comments with the parameters from my main file. This file contains 5 functions, with the first's purpose to be to clean a comment into a desired format. The second is to make a dictionary will all our keywords. The third is to classify comments into a specific emotion. The fourth is to make a list of all comments based off their country. The last is to make a report using all the data we have gathered from the previous functions.
